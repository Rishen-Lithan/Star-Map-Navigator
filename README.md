## 🚀 Features & Objectives

1. **Modern React Architecture**  
   Developed using **React functional components** with hooks for state and lifecycle management, ensuring a clean and modular codebase.

2. **NASA API Integration**  
   Successfully integrated multiple public APIs from [NASA's API Portal](https://api.nasa.gov/), allowing users to explore a variety of space-related data.

3. **Tailwind CSS Styling**  
   Employed **Tailwind CSS** to create a sleek, responsive, and maintainable UI design that enhances overall usability and user engagement.

4. **User Session Management**  
   Implemented mechanisms to manage user sessions, enhancing personalization and interaction consistency across the application.

5. **Testing & Quality Assurance**  
   Conducted comprehensive **functional and UI testing** to ensure smooth operation across different devices and browsers.
